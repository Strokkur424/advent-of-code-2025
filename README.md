# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

Link: https://adventofcode.com/2025/.

This repository contains my AoC code for 2025! It is structured by folders, each representing a different day.

Most solutions are made using **Java**. Due to the use of compact files, you need at least **JDK 25** to run these.

Example for running the second task of the first day:

```shell
cd day_1
java Day1_2.java
```

And that's all!
